Below is a list of MD5 hashes of the UNI value that you submitted in HW0.  

You can compute your hash by opening python and typing the following.  The `UNI` variable should have the same value as what you set in the assignment.

        import md5
        md5.new(UNI).hexdigest()


If you see your hash in the list below, then you successfully completed HW0.  We accepted all submissions that were on time and _attempted_ to complete the assignment.  
Otherwise your submission was either late or did not attempt the assignment.
