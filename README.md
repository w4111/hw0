# HW 0

* Assigned: 1/22
* Due: 1/25 10AM sharp

This assignment has two parts. In the first part, you will setup a programming environment and perform some data analysis. In the second part, you will fill out a Google form to describe a bit about yourself and understand the class expectations.

### Part 1: Data Analysis

For this lab, we've partnered with [Instabase](https://www.instabase.com/) to provide you with a hosted IPython environment. 
To get started, create an account on the [website](https://www.instabase.com/account/register?use_token=true) (note that this URL is special for this class). 
The service is still in beta, so:

* USE THE FOLLOWING TOKEN IN ORDER TO REGISTER: `ewu-columbia`
* Go to https://www.instabase.com/account/register?use_token=true
* Make sure you sign up with your  AB1235@columbia email!!!  
* If you did not register using the token, you can still enter the token at this login page: https://www.instabase.com/account/login?use_token=true

After you've signed up, login and follow the steps below - 

1. Create a new repository. Give it a name / description of your liking and set the visibility to private.
1. go to [https://www.instabase.com/ewu/w4111-public/fs/Instabase%20Drive/](https://www.instabase.com/ewu/w4111-public/fs/Instabase%20Drive/)
1. Select the `HW0` folder, click on "more", then "Copy", then pick your repository, and copy to `Instabase Drive`
   * `HW0` should now be in the `fs/Instabase Drive/` folder of your repository.
1. Navigate to the `HW0` folder in your repository, right click `hw0.ipynb` and open the file with `Jupyter`.  This will open the file using [Jupyter (used to be IPython) Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).
1. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete and submit homework 0
   * There are [numerous resources](https://www.google.com/search?q=jupyter%20tutorial) that can introduce you to Jupyter Notebook.


#### Enable Logging

* Go to your instabase account settings by clicking on the smiley face in the upper right of instabase.com, and then clicking on settings
* Click on "Application" in the left side bar
* Click "Enable logging" and then "Update Notebook Settings".
